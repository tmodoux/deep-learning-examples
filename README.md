# deep-learning-examples

Three applications of deep learning techniques using PyTorch :
- [Self-driving-car simulation](./car/README.md)
- [Doom](./doom/README.md)
- [Breakout](./breakout/README.md)

These projects and their source code are strongly inspired by the Udemy course [Artificial Intelligence A-Z 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/artificial-intelligence-az).
